  <body>
   <!-- The first thing we want to do is create
  a class of container inside the body.

    We walso want to use flexbox in order to get this content to the middle instead of at the top of the page
    so we need to use d-flex in order to first ENABLE the flexbox. The we can use flexbox behaviors. So now we
    can use align-items center now that we found on the website. At this point it's still not working. Why?
    if we debug using developer tools on the website, w ehave the container and then the body. Everything is in the container. We can see that the container is NOT the full page it is only the top part. therefore it is not centering on the page but the container itself. It is not covering the full page. So just like we did in 
    body and lok at the styles and see that we had height 
    at 100%. All we need to do is tell the container, hey i
    want you to span the entire height of the page. In bootstrap we can simply do that by saying h-100
   -->
    <div class="container d-flex align-items-center h-100">
      <!-- next we want the h1,hr and button to just be
      in a row.that's in the center of the page
      so we will wrap them in a div and give
      them a class of row  -->
      <div class="row">
        <!-- next let's divide up each item,
        h1,hr adn button into different sections -->
